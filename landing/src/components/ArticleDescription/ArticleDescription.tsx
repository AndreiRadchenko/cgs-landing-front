        TA project manager's responsibility and roles will vary depending on the
        project, but there is a general framework you can easily follow. A
        project's life cycle has four phases: the initiation of the project,
        planning, execution, and closure. Understanding the purpose of each
        stage is important for defining the functions of a project manager
        during each cycle, so you know you're meeting your team's – and
        stakeholders' – goals.

        Planning: After a project is approved, you and your team will get into
        the details of the project. As a PM, you will help identify goals that
        can be broken down into smaller tasks, establish roles within your team,
        and create a schedule in this phase. Think of the initiation phase as an
        outline and the planning phase as a summary of what you expect to
        happen. Here, the work of a project manager consists of making a project
        timeline, getting resources, like software, together, and constant
        documentation throughout the process. Overall, you're breaking down
        assignments into smaller parts for better oversight and finding possible
        hiccups before they become problems.
